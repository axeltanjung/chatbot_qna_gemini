## Chatbot Q&A PDF with Gemini

This module implements a chatbot for question and answer (Q&A) functionality using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Gemini model. The chatbot leverages the power of RAG to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers by combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.

### Key Features:
- **Question Understanding**: The chatbot can understand and process user questions, extracting key information and context.
- **Document Retrieval**: Utilizes a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents or information from a knowledge base or external sources.
- **Answer Generation**: Generates coherent and contextually appropriate answers using the Gemini model, which is fine-tuned for Q&A tasks.
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context to provide more accurate and relevant responses over multiple interactions.

### Usage:
- Initialize the chatbot with necessary configurations and knowledge base.
- Use the `ask_question` method to submit user questions and receive generated answers.
- Optionally, customize the retrieval and generation parameters to fine-tune the chatbot's performance.

### Dependencies:
- Requires the Gemini model and associated libraries for natural language processing and generation.
- A knowledge base or document repository for the retrieval component.

### Example:
```python
from chatbot_rag_gemini import ChatbotRAGGemini

config = {
    # Configuration parameters
}

chatbot = ChatbotRAGGemini(config)
answer = chatbot.ask_question("What is the capital of France?")
print(answer)  # Outputs: "The capital of France is Paris."
```

### Note:
- Ensure that the knowledge base is regularly updated to maintain the accuracy and relevance of the answers.
- The performance of the chatbot may vary based on the quality and comprehensiveness of the knowledge base.
